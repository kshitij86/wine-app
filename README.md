#### The name is a play on the popular short video app Vine (R.I.P).
_**wine**_ let's you record fun videos and share them with your friends.

### Short video app, the React Native way.

# Usage

Clone this repo and set up the `npm` package. 
Note that the app heavily depends on `expo-cli` and `expo` packages.

An apk for Android devices will be made available soon, as a release.

# Plans & Scope

1. Add a dedicated backend (video hosting + auth + related)
2. Eject from `expo` for good
3. Move up to a release build
4. Code clean-up (big time)

## Contributions are welcome, if you like the idea, don't forget to star the repo.
